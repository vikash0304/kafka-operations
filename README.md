# kafka-operations
This example provides a basic structure for a Spring Boot application that interacts with Kafka using REST APIs. You can extend and customize it to meet your specific use case and add more REST endpoints and business logic as needed.

# Kafka-about
Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform that is used for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications. It is designed to handle high volumes of data in a fault-tolerant and scalable manner. Kafka is commonly used for log aggregation, data integration, event sourcing, and real-time analytics.

# Kafka-producer
A Kafka producer is responsible for publishing messages to Kafka topics. Producers send records to specified topics, and Kafka takes care of distributing those records to the appropriate partitions within those topics. Producers can also specify a key for each message, which helps in message routing and partitioning.

# Kafka-consumer
A Kafka producer is a client application that publishes (writes) events to a Kafka cluster. Kafka is a distributed streaming platform that can be used to build real-time data pipelines and applications. Producers are used to send data to Kafka topics, which are durable and scalable storage mechanisms.
